### 💭 My Thoughts
- Although I would've liked something more significant to add to my thoughts for the week, everything seemed fairly straightforward. There were however, a few useful creases in my knowledge that were ironed out from the material we covered. One useful thing I learned was that you should use the @Override annotation when overriding methods (even if they aren't methods like toString() or equals() which would come from the Object parent class in Java, which I previously thought were the only places you should use the annotation). I felt good about what we covered regarding the abstract keyword. Polymorphism was good to review. We reviewed that has to do primarily with method overloading and overriding in inheritance, not type casting for objects, which I had previously thought was also part of Polymorphism. On that note, we did briefly cover type casting for object since it is related to inheritance. That was helpful to cover, but I felt like I already had a good understanding of that concept (especially upcast vs downcast in inheritance) before and after we covered it.

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?* <br>
